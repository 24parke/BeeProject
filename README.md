# BeeProject

Randomly sized cube from 25x25x25 to 50x50x50. 
Cube contains a 1x15 beehive randomly placed inside the cube. 
Beehive can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. 
Cube contains 15 bees randomly dispersed throughout the cube. 
30% of the cube populated with obstacles which bees cannot pass through. 

Your job is to move the bees from their initial location into the beehive in as few moves as possible. 
Bees can move 1 unit in any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) and that counts as a move. 

You need to display the starting location of each bee, the location of the beehive as well as the number of moves EACH bee made.  FInally, you need to display the SUM of all the moves made.
